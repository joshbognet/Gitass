    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img src="cannon.jpeg"  width="350px" height="380px"    >
        Here is what I know. I’m often thought of as a quiet, reserved, 
        and thoughtful individual.  I don’t seek out special attention or 
        social engagements.The idea of being alone is thrilling,<br>not taxing. 
        These periods of solitude are crucial to my health and happiness. 
        Whether I’m simply spending time resting or engaging in an activity, 
        solitude is a welcome relief. I often enjoy reading, coding, baking, gardening, 
        crafting, writing, gaming, watching movies, or<br> doing any other activity 
        that’s performed alone.
        </p>

    <p> I prefer a small circle of friends and that’s not a sign that I can’t make 
        friends or don’t like <br>to socialize. In fact, I enjoy talking with people and 
        getting to know others. I also prefer the solitude of a small circle of friends.<br> 
        High-quality relationships are a key to my happiness.You may also say I’m 
        introspective and curious. I find myself daydreaming or working things out in my 
        mind long before  I put a plan of action in place or lift a single finger to change 
        anything.  
    
    </p>
    <p>I have a very active inner thought process. That also leads me toward 
        self-reflection and research. I am dedicated to pursuing my interests and feeling 
        prepared and well-read. I’m accused of zoning out a lot. I often “escape” from a 
        situation by zoning out or letting my<br> mind wander away from the task at hand. For me,
        this may be a way to leave a situation<br>  that feels too chaotic or uncomfortable; it’s 
        a survival mechanism of sorts. But to others, it may seem like I’m unfocused. I’m more
        comfortable writing out my thoughts rather than speaking, especially when I’m 
        unprepared.
    </p>
    
    <p>I prefer to think through my response because my communication style is 
        focused and considerate. I can carry on conversations, but if decisions are necessary, 
        I may want more time to consider and weigh my options so I feel confident in the choice.
