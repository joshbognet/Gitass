        <h1>Code Plateau 3.0 (My Experience)</h1>
    
        <P><img src="cannon.jpeg"  width="350px" height="380px"    >
        My training to becoming a junior Software Developer at Code Plateau. 
        As well as a <br> new year, it was a completely new start for me, having 
        come from a <br>not-so-polished previous programming experience.
        I’ll admit, I was equally excited <br>as I was fearful of the challenges ahead. 
        On the one hand, I could not wait to learn to <br>code again- with an actual team 
        of software engineers supporting and helping me,<br> as opposed to flicking through 
        the pages of a teach-yourself Python book.
    </p>  
    
    <p>
        But on the other hand, I’d heard rumours about how intensive the previous  
        training <br>was and how how ours was going to be tougher. I mean, my imaginations 
        went wild <br>like, If you watch as much television as I do, you may have come across 
        this<br> ‘genius programmer’ who allegedly exist in the Google and Amazon sectors <br>of 
        the industry. They’re those hacker and Harvard graduate types - intimidatingly <br>
        clever people who are asked to write pages of complex code.
        
    </p>

    <p>Whilst the code zooms in front of your eyes, you’ll find them speaking 100 miles<br> per 
       hour in what seems like another language - confusing every non-programmer in <br>the room. 
       After witnessing this trope time and time again, I believed it myself.<br> I thought there 
       was not a chance that I could ever get to that level of expertise.
    </p>
    
    <p>Alternatively, I’d heard amazing stories of the previous sets of code plateau <br>2.0 
       programmers who landed themselves their dream developer job. People with<br> no experience 
       who had become top programmers from tackling the exercises of Code plateau and dabbling 
       with their own side<br> projects.
       This suggested that coding is not as scary as it seems and is something that everyone 
       can learn, no matter what their skill <br> set is. All it takes is commitment and enthusiasm. Hearing these positive stories gave me a confidence boost. Maybe it was <br> possible to learn programming in the same way.
   
    </p>
    <p>

        Weeks into my training, I’ve levelled my expectations. I no longer subscribe to the 
        extremes of ‘learning to code is easy’ and ’coding<br> is impossible’. I’ve accepted that 
        learning to code is a process.
    </p>
    
    <p> Like every other skill, there’s an individual learning curve. The reality is 
        that it’s neither so ridiculously complex that only the <br>scientist boffins can 
        understand it, nor is it as easy as following the fun environment.
    </p>
    
    <p> As I progress from setting my mindset being a complete beginner, some things are 
        becoming second nature. My lack of experience <br>causes me to make silly mistakes 
        sometimes, making me feel like I’m back at square one. But this is normal, I’m 
        learning from it after all.
    </p>
    <p>  Having spoken to other programmers at Companies House, I’m also encouraged by the 
        diversity of people’s backgrounds. Some, like me, have come from non-technical 
        backgrounds. Some have computer science degrees. But what they all have in common 
        is that they’ve been through that same ‘easy vs impossible’ conflict.
        </p> 
        
        
    <p>   Actually, it turns out what most people enjoy about programming is experiencing 
        these small struggles and small victories. Slowly but surely they build up your 
        confidence and knowledge. What gives me confidence now is looking back to what I 
        wrote a few months ago and realising just how much I’ve progressed.
        
    </p> 
    <p> This gives me the encouragement to push through in those moments of despair, 
        as ultimately, I know that I’ll come out the other side a better programmer.

        When i'm not in the coding environment, one thing i love doing is baking.
    I'm a professional bread baker with years of experience and i special in baking various sorts of tasty loaves. <br> new year, it was a completely new start for me, having 
    come from a <br>not-so-polished previous programming experience.
    I’ll admit, I was equally excited <br>as I was fearful of the challenges ahead. 
    On the one hand, I could not wait to learn to <br>code again- with an actual team 
    of software engineers supporting and helping me,<br> as opposed to flicking through
